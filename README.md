# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Introduction:

Credit risk analysis is a crucial task for financial institutions that need to assess the creditworthiness of customers before granting loans or credit. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly used to automate credit risk analysis. In this report, I will describe a credit risk analysis project that involves customer data cleaning, the application of machine learning concepts like clustering, SMOTE balancing, and analysis of results through Decision Tree and Random Forest classification. The project was implemented using Python.

Customer Data Cleaning:

The first step in the credit risk analysis project was to clean the customer data. This involved removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and converting categorical data into numerical data. The data was also standardized to ensure that all the features had the same scale.

Application of ML Concepts:

The next step was to apply machine learning concepts to the cleaned data. The first technique used was clustering, which involved grouping customers into clusters based on their credit profiles. This allowed the project team to identify different risk levels and tailor credit offers accordingly.

The second technique used was SMOTE balancing, which involved oversampling the minority class to balance the dataset. This was important to ensure that the machine learning models did not overemphasize the majority class and, in turn, underestimate the minority class.

Analysis of Results:

The final step was to analyze the results obtained from the machine learning models. Two models were used: Decision Tree and Random Forest classification. The performance of the models was evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The results showed that the Random Forest classification model performed better than the Decision Tree model. The model achieved an accuracy of 94%, a precision of 91%, a recall of 98%, and an F1 score of 94%. This indicated that the model was able to accurately predict whether a customer was a high-risk borrower or not.

Conclusion:

The credit risk analysis project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in automating credit risk analysis. The use of clustering and SMOTE balancing allowed the project team to identify different risk levels and ensure that the machine learning models did not overemphasize the majority class. The results obtained from the Decision Tree and Random Forest classification models demonstrated the potential of these models to accurately predict credit risk. The project highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches to credit risk analysis and the potential of machine learning techniques to improve credit risk assessment.
